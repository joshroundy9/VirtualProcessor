VIRTUAL PROCESSOR:
This was a project for the class ICSI 404 "Computer Architecture" where we built a Java program that simulates a processor and allows the user to give it instructions through a simple assembly language.

RUNNING THE PROJECT:
All you have to do to run this project is clone it into a folder, change the directory inside main/Assembler.java to be the path of the assembly file you want to run then run program.
